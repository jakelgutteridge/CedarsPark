  <h2>Wildlife Survey</h2>

    <p>In June 2017, a wildlife survey was commissioned by the Friends of Cedars Park and carried out by
      <a href="https://www.hertswildlifetrust.org.uk/" target="_blank">Herts & Middlesex Wildlife Trust</a>. This information
      has enabled the Council and Friends Group to more broadly understand the park's ecosystem, so that it may be looked after properly.</p>

  <h2>Birds</h2>

    <p>Many different bird species and varieties have been observed within Cedars Park. These include typical British
      birds such as robin, moorhens and owls & more exotic types such as parakeet species from India and Australia</p>

    <h2>Trees</h2>

    <p>Cedars Park contains a mature and diverse collection of trees from around the world. Between 2019 and 2021,
      volunteers from the Friends of Cedars Park identified and numbered all of the main trees in the park, allowing people
      to easily see the species of each tree and effectively creating a formal arboretum with a tree listing.</p>
  
   <p>CPRE Hertfordshire said: 'The tree project is a valuable asset helping visitors to discover the trees in the park.
     Their species lists and measurements . . . have contributed to our national knowledge of trees in cultivation'.</p>
