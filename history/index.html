    <p>Cedars Park is the former site of Theobalds Palace, the favourite residence
       of King James I.</p>

    <p>Theobalds originated as a smaller estate in the 14th century, but was expanded
       by Sir William Cecil for Queen Elizabeth I, who stayed there around 15 times.</p>

    <p>The house was later acquired by James I, who turned it into a grand palace
       with a 2500-acre deer park. For much of the Jacobean period, England was run
       right from these grounds, as the country was an absolute monarchy.</p>

    <p>Theobalds Palace was largely demolished during the English Civil War, and the
       grounds were donated to the public in 1919 as a public park.</p>
