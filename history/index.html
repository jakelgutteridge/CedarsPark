    <p>Cedars Park is the former site of Theobalds Palace, the favourite residence
       of King James I.</p>
    <p>Theobalds originated as a smaller estate in the 14th century, but was expanded
       by Sir William Cecil for Queen Elizabeth I, who stayed there around 15 times.</p>
    <p>The house was later acquired by James I, who turned it into a grand palace
       with a 2500-acre deer park. For much of the Jacobean period, England was run
       right from these grounds, as the country was an absolute monarchy.</p>
    <p>Theobalds Palace was largely demolished during the English Civil War, and the
       grounds were donated to the public in 1919 as a public park.</p>

    <blockquote>
    A most stately house ... To speak of the state and beauty thereof as large as it deserveth, for curious buildings,
    delightfull walkes, and pleasant conceites within and without, and other things very glorious and ellegant to be
    seene would challenge a great portion of this little treatise, and therefore least I should come shorte of that
    due commendation that it deserveth, I leave it, as indeed it is, a princely seate.
    <span>John Norden, 1598</span>
