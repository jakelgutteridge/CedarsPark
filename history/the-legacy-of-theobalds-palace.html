      <b>The King and Tinker</b> &ndash; Located on Whitewebbs Lane in Enfield, this historic pub dates
      back to the 16th century and is located on King James I's original hunting grounds. Their business card tells the story of the Ballad of the King and the Tinker:
      <p>
      <blockquote>
        Whilst hunting in the area and separated from his courtiers the king takes refuge in an alehouse
        where he enjoys a drink with a tinker. The tinker has no idea who he is drinking with until the
        courtiers catch up with the king and the tinker realises who his drinking companion really is, King James the 1st.
        <p>It is said that the King knighted the tinker and that this is the pub where their meeting took place.
