    <p>Cedars Park is a public park covering 19 acres in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire.
       It is the former site of Theobalds Palace, one of the most renowned English
       palaces of the Stuart period and King James I's favourite residence, where
       he spent the majority of his later life.
       The palace was destroyed during the English Civil War.

    <p>The purpose of this website is to provide useful information to the public
       and document the important history of this park.

  <h2>Facilities</h2>

    <p>Remaining structures of Theobalds Palace can be found around the park,
       including extant garden walls. Broxbourne Borough Council have honoured the
       rich history of Cedars Park with the provision of replica royal features,
       reduced models of the palace and bas reliefs of prominent historical figures
       &mdash; supported by Heritage Lottery funding.
