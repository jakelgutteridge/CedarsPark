    <p>Cedars Park is a public park covering 19 acres in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire.
      It is the former site of Theobalds Palace, one of the most renowned English
      palaces of the Stuart period and King James I's favourite residence, where
      he spent the majority of his later life.
      The palace was demolished in the 17th century and many elements (Grade II listed)
      are still standing.</p>

    <p>Today, Cedars Park is a very popular and attractive green space for the people
      of Cheshunt and the wider public who visit.
      You can get an impression of the park and its features from our <a href="photos">photo gallery</a>.</p></p>
  
  <h2>Friends of Cedars Park</h2>
  
    <p>The Friends of Cedars Park (FOCP) are a voluntary group established
       in 2005 to help maintain and improve the park. See the <a href="friends">Friends</a>
       page for more information.</p>
  
    <p>This website has been created by the Friends Group to provide useful information to the public
       about the park and document the important history of Theobalds Palace. This is where we will
       publish information from projects that we carry out. For updates on events and activities, please
